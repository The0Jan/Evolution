# Evolution

Task implementation for "Introduction To Artificial Inteligence" course.

Implement a classical evolutionary algorithm without crossover, with tournament selection and generational succession. Investigate how the number of individuals in the population affects the quality of solutions obtained with a limited computational budget (limited number of computations of the objective function).
